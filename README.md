## Reflection

This is a personal project I've been building by myself to learn Django better. I wanted to create an app that users could use to collaborate with their friends and share their ideas. To do this, I thought of making a message board application where users can post different types of media, such as text, videos, and pictures, to share their ideas with their friends.
